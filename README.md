A website for us to edit our dictionary!

I am creating a website for people to edit words like a co-shared dictionary. <br>
Different people have different understanding about words. <br>
At the beginning, I planed to create a dictionary to editing networds, to edit when we create the netword, how we use and how long it lasted. <br>
And in some areas, like plants growing, people will have different findings when growing a plant. <br>
They can record the plant's info using the co-dictionary. Like wikipedia, but more casual.<br>



其实我很早就想搞一个收集网络词汇or方言的平台。<br>
网络语言我觉得需要被记录下来，不一定是厚厚的词典，因为有些网络语言流行一段时间就消失匿迹了。<br>
但是我觉得需要
记录下来，研究
一下
